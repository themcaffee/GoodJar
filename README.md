 Positivity Jar / Good Jar
===========

## What is this?

The idea behind this is that whenever something good happens you write it down and put it into a jar. This is usually
done with a physical jar. On certain time intervals the jar would be opened and the good memories remembered. In this way it helps someone become more of a positive person overall by looking for the positive things rather than the negative. I built this during HackUState to create an easier and more secure way of storing memories. It was built in a day and won the Most Creative award. It saves memories for users and will send out emails containing the list of memories on predefined intervals that I have set up.

## What is the status of this?

The site is a little bit buggy and isn't ready to be released to actual users. The code is a little on the hacky-side (Get it? It was written during a hackathon.) I hope to revitalize this project but am too busy with other obligations currently.

## What if I want to build on this?

Go right ahead! Any contributions are very welcomed. If you want to know how to get started to just send me a message. 

## What's with the stupid name?

While this project won most creative, I couldn't come up with any better names. Suggestions welcome.
